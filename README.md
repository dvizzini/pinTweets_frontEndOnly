PinTweets
=========
This website maps Tweets found using Twitter's search API, principally by geocoding the names listed in Twitter user profiles. Its results are flawed but fun.

Wishlist
--------
* HTML5 this up for a phone
* Actually care about browsers other than Chrome.
* Add node backend
	* Enable sign-in so that people can see who they follow, use straming API?
	* Add learning mechanism for misplacced Tweets
	* Handle limit breach better. Use POST and the error will work. (Much less of an issue with the new Twitter lookup API.)
* Get hand icon to work better when dragging pin.
