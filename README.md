PinTweets
=========
This website maps Tweets found using Twitter's search API, principally by geocoding the names listed in Twitter user profiles. Its results are flawed but fun.

Wishlist
--------
*HTML5 this up for a phone
*Actually care about browsers other than Chrome.
*Add node backend
	*Enable sign-in so that people can see who they follow, use straming API?
	*Add learning mechanism for misplacced Tweets
	*Handle limit breach better. Use POST and the error will work. (Much less of an issue with the new Twitter lookup API.)
*Get hand icon to work better when dragging pin.
